To start working with the project, navigate to the project's folder using your favorite CLI tool,
For development built run `gulp` or `gulp dev`, the project will be built an served automatically in your browser.
For production built (this production version works well for the github pages and not tested for any other types of hosting) run `gulp prod`.

Enjoy!!!
