    	What would you do if you were omnipotent for a day? Well friends definitely know what they want, especially Joey :))
		Rachel got her first paycheck, isn't it exciting? She wiped tables for it, she steamed milk..... And it was totally..... not worth it :)
		And it's still the biggest news Rachel dumping Barry at the altar. The FICA guys took all Rachel's money, everyone she knows is getting or pregnant or promoted, and she's getting coffee, and it's not even for her... but she's okay... sounds like she doesn't have a plan and neither do Monica and Phoebe.
		Meanwhile Joey and Chandler are trying to cheer Ross up, because it's October 20th, it's the date when he and Carol first time... consummated their... physical relationship... Sex.

    	Women or Men, who have more benefits of pleasure... Our friends are going to tell you!
		Joey asks Monica to be his date tonight, because he got a double date with his ex-girlfriend Angela (he actually wants to get back together with) and her new boyfriend Bob (who's got a real job by the way, well, Joey just an actor, but Bob...). Monica thinks Bob is an Angela's brother, that's what Joey said to convince her to go with him:)). But no worries, everyone is getting what he wants.
		Chandler is going to break up with Janice, and this is gonna be fun! He's got to learn from Phoebe, She's really good at it, it's like a gift :))
		Ross finally got a date with Rachel! Technically they are just going to Launderama, but it's just 2 of them, so it seems like a date.
